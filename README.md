# EA Software Engineering Forage Job Simulation
This simulation is a hands on, self paced introduction to EA software engineering, letting me practice problem solving, coding in C++, and exploring real world game development tasks to build skills and career readiness. 

## Task 1: Write a Feature Proposal
In task one, I was asked to develop a feature proposal for EA SPORTS College Football. The proposal focuses on improving the experience for new players. It outlines an in-game tutorial that teaches core gameplay controls alongside fundamental football concepts. It evaluates the current lack of onboarding, explains the value of a structured tutorial for accessibility and player retention, and weighs the potential benefits and tradeoffs of implementing the feature within the existing game systems.

## Task 2: Create a Game Object Class

## Task 3: Improve Inventory System

## Task 4: Live Bugfix
